In Next.js 15, a particularly uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory's `async` data fetching methods coupled with dynamic routes and server components.  The issue surfaces when a race condition occurs between the loading of data within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` and the client-side hydration of the page. This can lead to unexpected behavior such as a blank screen or a delayed rendering of the UI with an incorrect state. This is especially tricky to diagnose because it doesn't always reproduce consistently. The problem often stems from the asynchronous nature of data fetching and the timing of the hydration process; if the client hydrates the page before the server-side props are fully resolved, inconsistencies can occur.  Adding console logs in both `getServerSideProps` and the client-side component's lifecycle may help pinpoint the exact timing of the issue.
